import Tokenizers

/// An inference engine that supports GPU-accelerated grammar-constrained generation.
///
/// Conforming engines can apply xgrammar bitmasks directly in the GPU sampling path,
/// eliminating the need to transfer logits to CPU for masking. This protocol is used as
/// a capability signal for routing (e.g., choosing pipelined vs. sequential constrained
/// strategies) and for testability (mock conformers in unit tests).
///
/// The session lifecycle follows a checkout/checkin pattern:
/// 1. Call `getOrCreateConstrainedSession` to obtain a handle (cached or fresh)
/// 2. Pass the handle to `generateConstrained` which drives the GPU loop
/// 3. The engine returns the handle to its internal cache after generation completes
///
/// Conformers must:
/// - Honor `maxTokens` by finishing the stream within that limit
/// - Return the session handle to cache in a `defer` block (even on error/cancellation)
// Core AI is iOS 27+ but the app deploys to iOS 18; gate every declaration
