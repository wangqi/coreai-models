/// A sampling configuration for controlling the randomness and diversity of token generation in language models.
///
/// Sampling parameters allow fine-tuning of the generation process to achieve different behaviors:
/// - **Temperature**: Controls overall randomness
/// - **TopK**: Limits vocabulary to K most likely tokens
/// - **TopP (nucleus)**: Limits vocabulary by cumulative probability threshold
/// - **MinP**: Limits vocabulary by minimum probability relative to the most likely token
///
/// ## Sampling Algorithm Order
/// When multiple parameters are set, they are applied in this order:
/// 1. Repetition penalty (logits modified based on token history)
/// 2. Temperature scaling (logits / temperature)
/// 3. MinP filtering (relative probability threshold)
/// 4. TopP filtering (cumulative probability cutoff)
/// 5. TopK filtering (hard limit on vocabulary)
/// 6. Softmax and multinomial sampling
///
/// ## Usage Example
/// ```swift
/// // Creative writing with high temperature
/// let creative = SamplingConfiguration(temperature: 0.8)
///
/// // Deterministic output
/// let deterministic = SamplingConfiguration.greedy
///
/// // TopK sampling for focused but varied output
/// let topK = SamplingConfiguration(temperature: 0.8, topK: 50)
///
/// // Nucleus (TopP) sampling
/// let nucleus = SamplingConfiguration(temperature: 0.9, topP: 0.95)
///
/// // MinP sampling (cheaper alternative to TopP)
/// let minP = SamplingConfiguration(temperature: 0.9, minP: 0.05)
///
/// // Combined TopK + TopP (recommended for best quality)
/// let combined = SamplingConfiguration(temperature: 0.8, topK: 50, topP: 0.9)
/// ```
