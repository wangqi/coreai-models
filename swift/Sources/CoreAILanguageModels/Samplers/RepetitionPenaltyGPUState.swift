/// Manages per-pipeline-depth penalty buffers for GPU repetition penalty.
///
/// Uses a split design to avoid races between GPU reads and CPU writes:
/// - `recordToken()`: updates only the CPU-side ring buffer (no MTLBuffer writes)
/// - `buffer(forStep:)`: writes the full penalty state to a specific buffer
///   slot, called at encode time when the gate guarantees that slot is not in use
///
/// Thread safety: relies on MPSGraph runAsync completions being dispatched in
/// submission order on a single MTLCommandQueue (observed behavior, validated by
/// `MPSGraphCompletionOrderingTests`). The gate further ensures that
/// `buffer(forStep:)` does not overlap with `recordToken` for the same slot.
// Core AI is iOS 27+ but the app deploys to iOS 18; gate every declaration
